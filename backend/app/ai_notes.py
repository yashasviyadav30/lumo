"""AI notes and mind map for a video, made by Gemini from the public YouTube URL (plan v3).

Gemini watches the video itself through Google's documented video-understanding feature; we never fetch
captions or scrape anything (Developer Policies III.D.7, III.E.6). Gemini's free tier keeps inputs, so it gets
only the public video URL, our fixed prompts and its own notes on the parts: never anything a user typed
(narrowed R4).

Notes are shared: one job per video and language. Long videos are read in 15-minute parts, two at a time (the
free models refuse big requests when busy, 2026-10-07), and each finished part is kept, so a retry only redoes the
parts that failed. A last text-only call turns the parts into notes for the whole video. A background loop runs
due jobs, retries busy answers within seconds and then backs off, and stops for the day when the free video
budget is used up.

- summary: one paragraph of 4 to 6 sentences (70 to 120 words) that covers everything the video covers: what it
  sets out to teach or argue, the main ideas in the order they come, and its conclusion. Concrete: name the topics,
  methods, rules and people; never a vague line like "this video explains a topic".
- brief: detailed study notes a student could revise from instead of watching ({brief_words} words). Markdown only:
  3 to 8 sections, each starting with a line "## Heading", then short paragraphs and/or "- " bullet lines. Cover
  every topic in the order taught, with the definitions, steps, examples, numbers, formulas and stories exactly as
  given. Mark key terms with **bold**. No intro like "In this video".
- points: {points} key points in the order they come. time = the MM:SS (or H:MM:SS) timestamp where it starts.
  title = at most 8 words. short = one clear sentence. detail = 2-5 sentences with the explanation, examples,
  numbers or formulas as given in the video.
- terms: 4-12 key terms, names or formulas the video uses, each with a clear 1-2 sentence meaning as used in the
  video (skip it only if the video has none).
- mindmap: a rich tree of every idea in the video with {map_size} nodes in all (count them: never fewer). One root
  (parent "") naming the subject; 4-7 branches by theme; 2-5 ideas under each branch; and under most ideas 1-3 nodes
